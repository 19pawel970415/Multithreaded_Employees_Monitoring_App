Task: Employee Management System Task Description:

You want to create an employee management system that uses threads for performing background computation and communication tasks. The system should support various operations, such as data processing, responding to interruption signals, and executing periodic tasks.

Requirements:

Computation Thread (Callable Task):

Create a class EmployeeDataProcessor that implements the Callable<Integer> interface.
This class will simulate calculating the sum of employee salaries. It should take a list of salaries and return their sum.
Use the ExecutorService class to run multiple instances of EmployeeDataProcessor in parallel to compute the sum of salaries.
Thread State Monitoring (Thread Interruption):

Create a class WorkerThread that implements Runnable and performs a task (e.g., simulating long-running processing).
Use the interrupt() method to send an interruption signal to the thread and check how the thread reacts to this signal.
Synchronization and Thread Safety:

Create a class EmployeeDatabase with methods addEmployeeSalary() and getTotalSalaries(), using synchronization to ensure safe operations on the salary list.
Apply an atomic variable or the volatile keyword for thread state synchronization.
Task Scheduling (ScheduledExecutorService):

Use ScheduledExecutorService to periodically execute a task that periodically checks the status of salary processing and updates reports.
Waiting for Thread Completion (Join):

Create several threads performing different tasks and use the join() method to wait for their completion before ending the main thread.
Implementation:

Step 1: Create Classes:

EmployeeDataProcessor (implementing Callable<Integer>)
WorkerThread (implementing Runnable)
EmployeeDatabase (with synchronization)
ReportUpdater (periodic task using ScheduledExecutorService)
Step 2: Use ExecutorService and ScheduledExecutorService:

Run EmployeeDataProcessor tasks using ExecutorService.
Run the ReportUpdater task using ScheduledExecutorService.
Monitor and interrupt WorkerThread threads using the interrupt() method.
Step 3: Synchronization:

Ensure safe operations on the salary list in EmployeeDatabase through synchronization.
Step 4: Testing:

Test the system to ensure that all components work correctly: computations are performed, interruptions are handled, periodic tasks are executed, and threads are properly synchronized.
